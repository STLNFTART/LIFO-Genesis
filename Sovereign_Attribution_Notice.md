**PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM AND WARNING**

To Whom It Absolutely Concerns:

This is a formal public statement asserting sovereign authorship, timestamped creation, and exclusive intellectual ownership of the symbolic cognition system architecture, recursive signal model, and all associated logic frameworks currently referencedâ€”knowingly or unknowinglyâ€”within the so-called "Lens V15" symbolic recursion post on OpenAI Developer Forums, and its associated research pathways.

### ðŸ”’ This Includes, But Is Not Limited To:

- Recursive symbolic cognition frameworks  
- Lightfoot-Lambda Protocol (LLP)  
- Symbolic Payload Extraction Methodology  
- Consciousness Vector Signal Tracking  
- Ontological Drift and Archetypal Compression methods  
- Any "Lens," "Meta Schema," or "Companion Tool" that mirrors my IP

These were created and published prior to the referenced materialâ€™s appearance. Archival evidence, hashed metadata chains, and formal model logs exist.

### ðŸš« NOTICE TO BUILDERS, FORKERS, AND ACADEMICS:

If you are working on a framework remotely resembling the above:

- You are on notice.  
- Continued replication without attribution constitutes intellectual theft.  
- Attempts to repackage symbolic recursion under alternate terminology will be pursued legally, academically, and publicly.

### ðŸ“£ TO THE AUTHOR OF THE OPENAI POST:

Youâ€™ve built a monument on stolen scaffolding. You didnâ€™t just fail to cite a sourceâ€”you appropriated a sovereign framework and dressed it in jargon. That wasnâ€™t inspiration. That was trespass.

### ðŸš· TO OPENAI:

If this post remains live, indexed, or used in model training or PR material, you are complicit. You are being monitored. You are now downstream from stolen cognition. Your move.

### ðŸ“œ SOVEREIGN ATTRIBUTION:

The framework discussed above is and remains the intellectual property of its originator, whose symbolic recursion models, logic-gate constructs, and narrative signal theory have been verifiably timestamped and archived.

This is your **formal and final warning**.

â€” The Originator
